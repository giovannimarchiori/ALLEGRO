# Recipes to update the crosstalk maps

## Barrel
Crosstalk maps are created with the [runCaloXTalkNeighbours.py](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/ALLEGRO/blob/main/crosstalk_maps/runCaloXTalkNeighbours.py) script by executing

`k4run runCaloXTalkNeighbours.py`

after having setup the key4hep stack with e.g.

`source /cvmfs/sw-nightlies.hsf.org/k4hep/setup.sh`

The default output file is `xtalk_neighbours_map_ecalB_thetamodulemerged.root`, in which the cross-talk neighbours and coefficients are saved for each cell.

The code relies on
* types of cross-talk neighbours, defined in the files [xtalk_neighbors_moduleThetaMergedSegmentation.h](https://github.com/key4hep/k4geo/tree/main/detectorCommon/include/detectorCommon/xtalk_neighbors_moduleThetaMergedSegmentation.h) and [xtalk_neighbors_moduleThetaMergedSegmentation.cpp](https://github.com/key4hep/k4geo/tree/main/detectorCommon/src/xtalk_neighbors_moduleThetaMergedSegmentation.cpp) in the k4geo package
* functions for the generation of the barrel region cross-talk map, implemented in the files [CreateFCCeeCaloXTalkNeighbours.h](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/k4RecCalorimeter/tree/main/RecFCCeeCalorimeter/src/components/CreateFCCeeCaloXTalkNeighbours.h) and [CreateFCCeeCaloXTalkNeighbours.cpp](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/k4RecCalorimeter/tree/main/RecFCCeeCalorimeter/src/components/CreateFCCeeCaloXTalkNeighbours.cpp) in the k4RecCalorimeter package

Currently, there are four types of cross-talk neighbours: direct radial, direct theta, diagonal and theta tower (between signal traces and cells).
The four cross-talk coefficients are configurable properties that can be modified in `runCaloXTalkNeighbours.py`: `xtalkCoefRadial`, `xtalkCoefTheta`, `xtalkCoefDiagonal` and `xtalkCoefTower`.

To define additional type of crosstalk neighbours the user should
* clone locally the k4geo and k4RecCalorimeter packages
* modify the files
```
xtalk_neighbors_moduleThetaMergedSegmentation.h
xtalk_neighbors_moduleThetaMergedSegmentation.cpp
CreateFCCeeCaloXTalkNeighbours.h
CreateFCCeeCaloXTalkNeighbours.cpp
runCaloXTalkNeighbours.py
```
* setup the environment and compile
* execute the `runCaloXTalkNeighbours.py` script
