# ECAL barrel

## Per-layer sampling fractions

### Recipe

Average per-layer sampling fractions used in ALLEGRO o1_v03 and o2_v01 as of July 2026 have been calculated as follows, using a simulated sample (10k events) of electrons, 20 GeV, flat theta distribution, magnetic field on:

1. Setup the release
```
mkdir samplingfractions
cd samplingfractions
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/gmarchio/FCC-scripts.git
source FCC-scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

2. Modify the code

Edit the file `samplingfractions/run/run_all_chain.sh`, and set
```
doSamplingFractions=1
```

Set the other doXXX flags to 0

3. Run the code

Start from a fresh shell, go to the samplingfractions folder and execute
```
source env.sh
cd run
./run_all_chain.sh
```

The sampling fractions are saved in the file `sampling/SF.json` of the output directory.
This directory also contains plots of the gaussian fits used to determine the average value of the SF, as well as the root files produced by the simulations.

### How the code works

- the xml file of of the ECAL barrel used for the simulation (and reconstruction) is replaced with an xml file in which also the passive material is made active.
- the simulated files are reconstructed with the reconstruction script `FCC-scripts/fcc_ee_samplingFraction_inclinedEcal.py` that schedules the algorithm SamplingFractionInLayers to fill histograms of the active and total energy deposited in each layer and the sampling fraction.
- the histograms in the ROOT files are then fit to determine the average value with the script `FCC-scripts/FCC_calo_analysis_cpp/plot_samplingFraction.py`

### Notes

1. If you want to look at SFs vs E (10-20-50-100 GeV) or theta (E=10 GeV, theta = 50-60-70-80-90 degrees) do
```
doStudySFvsETheta=1
```

2. the script runs the jobs in parallel on multiple cores, the number of cores to be used can be modified in `run/runParallel.py` (variable `nCores`)



# ECAL endcap

There are two different approaches available for the endcap, one based on a direct assessment of the sampling fraction of each cell, and one based on an empirical determination of the calibration constant for each cell.

### Direct assessment of sampling fractions
For the direct assessment, one follows a procedure similar to that used for the barrel.  First, run a set of single particles using the *calib* version of the detector xml file, where the absorbers and readout PCBs are set to sensitive. To do so, after having cloned k4geo and k4RecCalorimeter, modify the ALLEGRO main xml file in k4geo
```
-  <include ref="ECalEndcaps_Turbine_o1_v03.xml"/>
+  <include ref="ECalEndcaps_Turbine_o1_v03_calibration.xml"/>
```
Then update the environment variable `$K4GEO` so that it points to your local folder (no need to compile k4geo)
```
export K4GEO=path/to/k4geo/
```
You only need to run the simulation step, not reconstruction. For instance
```
ddsim --enableGun --gun.distribution uniform --gun.energy "40*GeV" --gun.particle e- --gun.thetaMin "5*degree" --gun.thetaMax "40*degree" --numberOfEvents 10000 --outputFile ALLEGRO_calibration_sim_40GeV_10000ev_electrons.root --compactFile $K4GEO/FCCee/ALLEGRO/compact/ALLEGRO_o1_v03/ALLEGRO_o1_v03.xml
```
Then run
```
k4run fcc_ee_samplingFraction_turbineECalEndcap_siminput.py`
```
With the following lines edited to match your configuration:
```
\# Electron momentum in GeV
momentum = 40

iosvc.Input = "root/allegro_v03_evts_10000_*sim.root"
```

This will produce a file histSF_fccee_turbineECalEndcap.root.

The last step is to fit the histograms from that root file to extract the sampling fractions:

The last step is to fit the histograms from that root file to extract the sampling fractions. To do so, we need in particular the module `calo_init`, which is in `k4RecCalorimeter/RecFCCeeCalorimeter/scripts/`:
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/your/path/to/k4RecCalorimeter/RecFCCeeCalorimeter/scripts/
python plot_turbineEcalEndcap_samplingFraction.py histSF_fccee_turbineECalEndcap.root 40 --axisMin=-0.01 --axisMax=0.5
```
Some plots are also produced in the folder plots_sampling_fraction

**Notes/caveats**:  The extraction of the sampling fractions tends to not be as reliable for the endcap as the barrel.  This is because each cluster essentually deposits some energy in all of the calibration layers of the barrel (since the layers are arranged in depth), but that is not the case for the endcap, where layers are arranged in both depth and in the rho coordinate.  This means that most layers are empty for any one given cluster, leading to a large low-side tail in the sampling fraction plots that can make the fit unreliable.  It is generally the case that using the sampling fractions as calibration constants allows one to reconstruct the correct cluster energy to within 1% for the barrel; for the endcap the variation is closer to 10%.  So for precise studies of the endcap performance, the empirical determination of calibration constants described below is preferable.

### Empirical determination of calibration constants

For this procedure, one generates a large set of single-particle events (single photons may be best, as they are not affected by the B field). After having cloned k4geo and FCC-config, remove/comment the upstream detectors from the main xml (so that the performance of the endcap calorimeter can be isolated)
```
  <!-- <include ref="LumiCal.xml"/>                       -->
  <!-- <include ref="VertexComplete_IDEA_o1_v03.xml"/>    -->
  <!-- <include ref="DriftChamber_o1_v02.xml"/>           -->
  <!-- <include ref="SiliconWrapper_o1_v03.xml"/>         -->
```
Then update the environment variable `$K4GEO` and simulate some events (typically 100k particles at 40 GeV) uniformly distributed in theta and phi across the theta values relevant to the endcap (5 to 40 degrees)
```
export K4GEO=path/to/k4geo/
ddsim --enableGun --gun.distribution uniform --gun.energy "40*GeV" --gun.particle gamma --gun.thetaMin "5*degree" --gun.thetaMax "40*degree" --numberOfEvents 100000 --outputFile ALLEGRO_calibration_sim_40GeV_100000ev_gamma.root --compactFile $K4GEO/FCCee/ALLEGRO/compact/ALLEGRO_o1_v03/ALLEGRO_o1_v03.xml
```
Modify the reconstruction steering file in FCC-config to use sampling fraction of 1 for each cell in the endcap, commenting or deleting the original settings
```
# ecalEndcapSamplingFraction = [0.0897818] * 1+ [0.221318] * 1+  [...] +[1] * 1+ [1] * 1
ecalEndcapSamplingFraction = [1.0] * 98
```
Run the reconstruction, saving cells and hits, e.g.
```
k4run FCC-config/FCCee/FullSim/ALLEGRO/ALLEGRO_o1_v03/run_digi_reco.py --saveCells --saveHits --IOSvc.Input /path/to/ALLEGRO_calibration_sim_40GeV_100000ev_gamma.root --IOSvc.Output ALLEGRO_calibration_reco_40GeV_100000ev_gamma.root
```
The resulting reconstructed events are then processed by the ROOT macro `turbineEcalEndcap_autoCalib_analytic_topo.C`, as follows
```
TChain *t =  new TChain("events")
t->Add("set of reconstructed files")
.L turbineECalEndcap_autoCalib_analytic_topo.C+
turbineECalEndcap_autoCalib_analytic_topo a(t)
a.Calibrate()
```
The result will be a file `turbineEcalEndcap_samplingFractionsAnalytic.txt` that contains the calibration constants is a format that can be directly inserted into the reconstruction steering file.

**Notes/caveats**: this process is based on the assumption that the true energy of each cluster is 40 GeV.  If you generated the particles at the different energy, you will need to edit the following line in `turbineEcalEndcap_autoCalib_analytic_topo.C`:
```
define Etrue 40.0
```
Also, since this procedure operates under the assumption that all of the energy was deposited in the endcap, it does not give appropriate calibrations for the cells at the outer edge of the endcap that are "shadowed" by the barrel.  It is much better to use the direct sampling fraction approach for multi-subsystem studies that include that region.
